    <h1>Fibonacci Heaps and Dijkstra's Algorithm - A Visualization</h1>
    <h4>Kennedy Bailey</h4>

    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Single Source Shortest Path Problem is a simple, common, but practically applicable
      problem in the realm of algorithms with real-world applications and
      consequences. It’s the problem of finding the distance from one vertex in
      a graph to every other vertex in the graph. In the real world, this
      problem is most often translated to finding the shortest distance between
      locations for land, water, and air travel, but it can also be used to
      simulate networking and layout problems, and state-based problems, like
      puzzles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most well-known algorithmic solution to this problem is
      Dijkstra's Algorithm, which uses a priority queue to keep track of the
      vertices that have been visited and their current distances from the source.
      It's in this priority queue where optimizations for this algorithm are typically
      made. One way to implement this priority queue is as a Fibonacci heap. The interactive
      visualizations here serve to show how Fibonacci heap operations actually
      work, both as a standalone heap and when used in Dijkstra's Algorithm as
      a priority queue.

    </p>

    <h2 id="Dijkstra">Dijkstra's Algorithm</h2>
    <p>Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest route from one vertex,
       called the source, to all others in a weighted graph, but it can be adapted
       to focus the distance to one node, called a target.
       <h4>Algorithm Overview:</h4>
    <p>
      Let the distance of vertex Y be the distance from the source vertex to Y.
      Dijkstra's algorithm will assign some initial distance values and will try
      to improve them step by step.
    </p>
       <ol>
         <li>Mark all vertices unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited vertices
             called the unvisited set.</li>
         <li>Assign to every vertex a tentative distance value: set it to zero for
             our source vertex and to infinity for all other vertices. Set the
             source vertex as current.</li>
         <li>For the current vertex, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and
             calculate their tentative distances through the current vertex by adding
             the weight of the edge connecting the current vertex and neighbor to
             the current vertex's assigned value.
             Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current
             assigned value and assign the smaller one.</li>
         <li>When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the
             current vertex, mark the current vertex as visited and remove it from
             the unvisited set. A visited vertex will never be checked again.</li>
         <li>Once all reachable vertices are marked, then stop.</li>
         <li>Otherwise, select the unvisited vertex that is marked with the
             smallest tentative distance, set it as the new "current vertex", and
             go back to step 3.</li>
       </ol>

    <h4>How to Use the Tool:</h4>
    <div class="tutorial">
      <p>
        The "Randomize" button generates a semi-random graph with directed
        and weighted edges. The "Step" button steps through Dijkstra's algorithm
        until all shortest paths are found. In the tool, the source vertex is
        initially marked in red. When a vertex is visited, it is marked in green.

    <h2 id="Fibonacci">Fibonacci Heaps</h2>
    <p>
      Fibonacci heaps are sometimes referred to as “lazy” data structures
      because their structure is less strictly managed as they perform
      operations than in many other data structures. But this “laziness” allows
      them to have extremely fast amortized time complexities for common heap
      operations.

        <tr>
          <th>Operation</th>
          <th>Time Complexity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><code>insert()</code></th>
          <th><code>O(1)</code></th>
        </tr>

    <p>
      Fibonacci heaps are implemented using a circular and doubly-linked root list
      of heap-ordered trees in which each node contains a pointer to its parent
      and to one of its children. The children of each node are doubly-linked in
      a circular linked list. There is always a pointer to the node with the minimum key
      in the heap. It is this high connectivity between nodes that allows <code>O(1)</code>
      time insertion, minimum-reporting, deletion, key-decreasing, and merging.

        First, hit the "Initialize Heap" button to set up the Fibonacci heap. From there,
        enter numerical values in the input box and hit the "Insert" button to
        insert them into the heap. The "Delete Minimum" button removes the minimum
        value from the heap and the "Delete Key" button deletes the value in the
        input box from the heap if it exists.

    <h2 id="Together">Putting Them Together</h2>
    <p>
      Dijkstra's original shortest path algorithm does not use a priority queue,
      and inefficiently runs in <code>O(V<sup>2</sup>)</code> time. When using
      a Fibonacci heap as a priority queue, it runs in <code>O(E + V log V)</code>
      time, which is asymptotically the fastest known time complexity for this problem.
      However, due to their programming complexity, and for some practical purposes,
      Fibonacci heaps are not always a necessary or significant improvement.
      Fibonacci heaps are best reserved for applications in which the number of deletions
      is small compared to the use of other operations. In further iterations of this
      interactive, the efficacy of different priority queue implementations could
      be tested with timing tests for graphs of different sizes and properties.
      For now, animation overhead erases any improvements made by the Fibonacci heap,
      and this interactive solely shows a visualization of the two structures in action.

        First, hit the "Randomize" button to generate a semi-random graph and read
        its data into the Fibonacci heap. From there, hit the step button to step through
        Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path from a source node (marked in red)
        to one specific target node (marked in blue) and watch the changes in the
        Fibonacci heap reflected in its visualization.
