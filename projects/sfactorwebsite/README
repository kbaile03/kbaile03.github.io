******************************** FILES SUMMARY *********************************

  README - this

  index.html - home page
  members.html - members page
  aboutUs.html - about us page

  input_form.py - python script to generate data.json for use in members.js based
    on user input (have people in the group fill this out!)
  data.json - members json data generated by input_form.py

  js/members.js - javascript code that populates the members.html page based on
    json data

  images/group_pics - directory containing general pics for pages
  images/icons - directory containing various icon assets
  images/Logo - directory containing S-Factor Logo assets
  images/members - directory containing member photos

************************************ NOTES *************************************

  The members page uses JSON data to populate the page with member info,
  but there are a few invariants it relies on -
    - member photos exist in images/members/ with name "firstnamelastname.jpg"
        (all lowercase)
    - member photos should be cropped such that the person's face is
        centered or slightly above the center
    - if any booleans in the JSON data are true, pls ensure there is
        proper data for whatever that corresponds to
    - pls compress and reduce size of images - the page load times will be crazy
        otherwise and I don't really know how to dynamically do that (I generally
        keep them <= 1000px wide with medium jpeg compression, but I might aim for
        even smaller files)

  The python script input_form.py is a simple program that can write the JSON
  data for you from user input. It writes it to a file "data.json" which can be
  copied verbatim to the list variable member in members.js to populate the members
  page correctly. you can also use it for single users but have to append the data
  in members.js correctly.

********************************** DEV LOG *************************************
