Notes:

  The members page uses JSON data to populate the page with member info,
  but there are a few invariants it relies on -
    - distinct last names
    - member photos exist in members directory with name "lastname.jpg"
    - member photos should be cropped such that the person's face is
        centered or slightly above the center
    - if any booleans in the JSON data are true, pls ensure there is
        proper data for whatever that corresponds to
