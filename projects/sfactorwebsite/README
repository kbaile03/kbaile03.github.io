Notes:

  The members page uses JSON data to populate the page with member info,
  but there are a few invariants it relies on -
    - member photos exist in images/members/ with name "firstnamelastname.jpg" (all lowercase)
    - member photos should be cropped such that the person's face is
        centered or slightly above the center
    - if any booleans in the JSON data are true, pls ensure there is
        proper data for whatever that corresponds to

  The python script input_form.py is a simple program that can write the JSON
  data for you from user input. It writes it to a file "data.json" which can be
  copied verbatim to the list variable member in members.js to populate the members
  page correctly. you can also use it for single users but have to append the data
  in members.js correctly.
